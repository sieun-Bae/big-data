FAQ | How to show your code to teaching staff?

To define the problem quicker and more precisely we need to see the source code of your submission. Please do the following steps:

1) resubmit the task 
2) click on the "Get logs" button 
3) publish the last line of the logs. This line should start with "Source notebook".

This path is on the remote machine which is a part of our infrastructure. Source code is not accessible to anyone except you and our developers.
